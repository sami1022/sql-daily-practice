## Day 57 – UNION (Combine Results)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**online_orders**
- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- amount (DECIMAL)

**store_orders**
- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- amount (DECIMAL)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Combine all orders from both tables
2. Remove duplicate records while combining
3. Understand column compatibility rules
4. Compare UNION vs UNION ALL
5. Sort the combined result

Focus on combining result sets using UNION.
