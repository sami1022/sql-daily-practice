## Day 04 – DISTINCT (Remove Duplicates)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- course (VARCHAR)

The table may contain **duplicate values** in some columns.

Write SQL queries to:

1. Retrieve all unique cities from the students table  
2. Retrieve distinct courses taken by students  
3. Retrieve distinct combinations of city and course  
4. Count the number of distinct cities  
5. Retrieve unique marks scored by students in descending order  
6. Retrieve distinct city names where marks are greater than 70  

Focus on using the DISTINCT keyword correctly.
