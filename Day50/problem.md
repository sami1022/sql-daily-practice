## Day 50 – Views (CREATE VIEW)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**customers**
- customer_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- city (VARCHAR)

**orders**
- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- order_date (DATE)
- amount (DECIMAL)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Create a view that shows customer order details
2. Create a view for total revenue per customer
3. Query data from a view
4. Update a simple view (if allowed)
5. Drop a view

Focus on understanding how CREATE VIEW works.
