## Day 29 – Subqueries (Basics)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find students who scored more than the average marks
2. Find students with the highest marks
3. Find students from cities where the average marks are greater than 70
4. Retrieve students whose marks match the minimum marks
5. Understand how subqueries work inside SQL statements

Focus on understanding **basic subqueries**.
