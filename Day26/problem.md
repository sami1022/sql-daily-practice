## Day 26 – JOIN + WHERE (Filtering Joins)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**students**
- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- city (VARCHAR)

**enrollments**
- enrollment_id (INT)
- student_id (INT)
- course (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Retrieve students enrolled in a specific course
2. Find students from a specific city who are enrolled
3. Retrieve enrollments only for valid students
4. Find students who are enrolled in more than one course
5. Understand how WHERE filters results after JOIN

Focus on applying filtering logic on joined tables.
