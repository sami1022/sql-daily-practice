## Day 15 – PRIMARY KEY (Constraints)

### Problem Statement

You are designing a database table to store student information.

The table must ensure:
- Each record is uniquely identifiable
- Duplicate records are not allowed
- NULL values are not allowed in the identifier column

Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a table with a PRIMARY KEY
2. Insert valid records into the table
3. Attempt to insert a duplicate PRIMARY KEY value
4. Attempt to insert a NULL value into the PRIMARY KEY column
5. Understand how PRIMARY KEY enforces data integrity

Focus on understanding PRIMARY KEY as a database constraint.
