## Day 58 – UNION ALL (Deep Dive)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**online_orders**
- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- amount (DECIMAL)

**store_orders**
- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- amount (DECIMAL)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Combine results using UNION ALL
2. Compare performance between UNION and UNION ALL
3. Count duplicates in combined dataset
4. Filter combined results
5. Use UNION ALL inside subqueries

Focus on understanding behavior and performance differences.
