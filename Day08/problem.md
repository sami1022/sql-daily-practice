## Day 08 – Aggregate Functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Count the total number of students  
2. Count the number of students from each city  
3. Find the total marks scored by all students  
4. Find the average marks of all students  
5. Find the average marks of students from each city  
6. Count how many students scored more than 60 marks  

Focus on understanding aggregate functions and how they summarize data.
