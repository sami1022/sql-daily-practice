## Day 09 – MIN & MAX (Extreme Values)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find the minimum marks scored by any student  
2. Find the maximum marks scored by any student  
3. Find the minimum and maximum age of students  
4. Find the highest marks scored in each city  
5. Find the lowest marks scored in each city  
6. Find the maximum marks scored by students older than 18  

Focus on using MIN and MAX aggregate functions correctly.
