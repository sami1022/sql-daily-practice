## Day 38 – LIKE (Pattern Matching)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `employees` with the following columns:

- employee_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- email (VARCHAR)
- city (VARCHAR)
- department (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find employees whose name starts with a specific letter
2. Find employees whose name ends with a specific letter
3. Find employees whose name contains a specific word
4. Find employees using single-character wildcards
5. Understand pattern matching using the LIKE operator

Focus on **pattern matching using LIKE**.
