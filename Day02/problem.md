## Day 02 – WHERE Clause with AND / OR



You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Select all students who scored more than 70 marks  
2. Select students who scored more than 70 marks **and** belong to the city 'Pune'  
3. Select students who scored more than 85 marks **or** belong to the city 'Mumbai'  

Focus on using:
- WHERE clause
- AND operator
- OR operator
