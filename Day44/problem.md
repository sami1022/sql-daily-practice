## Day 44 – CASE + Aggregate (Categorization with GROUP BY)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `sales` with the following columns:

- sale_id (INT)
- product_name (VARCHAR)
- category (VARCHAR)
- amount (DECIMAL)
- sale_date (DATE)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Categorize sales into High, Medium, and Low value
2. Count number of sales in each category
3. Calculate total revenue by category using CASE
4. Count high-value transactions
5. Use CASE with GROUP BY for reporting

Focus on combining CASE with aggregate functions.
