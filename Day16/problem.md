## Day 16 – FOREIGN KEY (Relationships)

### Problem Statement

You are designing a relational database with two tables:
- `students`
- `enrollments`

The database must ensure:
- Each enrollment belongs to a valid student
- Referential integrity between tables
- Invalid references are not allowed

Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a parent table with a PRIMARY KEY
2. Create a child table with a FOREIGN KEY referencing the parent
3. Insert valid records into both tables
4. Attempt to insert an invalid FOREIGN KEY value
5. Understand how FOREIGN KEY maintains relationships

Focus on understanding FOREIGN KEY constraints and table relationships.
