## Day 21 – Revision (Constraints Recap)

### Topics Covered

This revision consolidates all SQL constraint concepts learned so far:

1. PRIMARY KEY
2. FOREIGN KEY
3. UNIQUE
4. NOT NULL
5. CHECK
6. DEFAULT
7. Composite PRIMARY KEY
8. Referential Integrity

The goal is to revise how constraints work together to
maintain data integrity in real-world database systems.
