### Explanation

- Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions in the WHERE clause.
- AND returns rows only when all conditions are true.
- OR returns rows when at least one condition is true.
- NOT is used to negate a condition and exclude specific rows.
- AND has higher precedence than OR, so parentheses are important in complex conditions.
- Using parentheses improves readability and avoids logical mistakes.

Common Interview Traps:
- Using OR incorrectly with NOT conditions
- Forgetting parentheses in AND + OR combinations
- Comparing string values without quotes

These concepts are frequently tested in SQL interviews and real-world data filtering tasks.
