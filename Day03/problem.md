## Day 03 – Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)

### Problem Statement

  You are given a table `students` with the following columns:
  
  - id (INT)
  - name (VARCHAR)
  - marks (INT)
  - city (VARCHAR)
  - age (INT)
  
  Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks:
  
  1. Select students who scored more than 70 AND are older than 18  
  2. Select students who are from Pune OR Mumbai  
  3. Select students who are NOT from Delhi  
  4. Select students who scored more than 80 AND are NOT from Mumbai  
  5. Select students who are younger than 18 OR scored less than 40  
  6. Select students whose marks are greater than 60 AND age is between 18 and 25  
  7. Select students who are NOT from Pune and have marks less than 50  
  8. Select students who are from Pune AND scored more than 75 OR scored more than 90  
  9. Select students who are older than 18 AND (scored more than 70 OR are from Pune)  
  10. Exclude students who are from Delhi AND scored less than 40
  
  Focus on correct usage of logical operators and parentheses.
