## Day 05 – ORDER BY (Sorting Data)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Sort students by marks in ascending order  
2. Sort students by marks in descending order  
3. Sort students by city alphabetically  
4. Sort students by marks (descending) and then by age (ascending)  
5. Retrieve students with marks greater than 60 and sort them by marks  
6. Retrieve distinct cities and sort them alphabetically  

Focus on correct usage of the ORDER BY clause.
