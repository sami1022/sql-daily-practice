### Explanation

- ORDER BY is used to sort the result set of a query.
- ASC sorts data in ascending order (default).
- DESC sorts data in descending order.
- Multiple columns can be used in ORDER BY to define secondary sorting.
- ORDER BY is always written at the end of a SELECT statement.
- ORDER BY can be combined with WHERE and DISTINCT.

Common Interview Traps:
- Forgetting that ASC is the default sorting order
- Using ORDER BY before WHERE (incorrect)
- Sorting without understanding column precedence

ORDER BY is widely used in reporting and analytics queries.
