## Day 59 – INTERSECT (Common Rows)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**online_customers**
- customer_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)

**store_customers**
- customer_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find customers present in both tables
2. Compare INTERSECT with INNER JOIN
3. Use INTERSECT with multiple columns
4. Count common records
5. Understand duplicate behavior

Focus on retrieving common rows using INTERSECT.
