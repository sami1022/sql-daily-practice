### Practice Set

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Solve the following real-world aggregate problems:

1. Count total number of students
2. Count students city-wise
3. Find average marks of all students
4. Find average marks city-wise
5. Find the highest marks overall
6. Find the lowest marks overall
7. Find cities where average marks are greater than 70
8. Find cities having more than 3 students
9. Find total marks scored city-wise where total is greater than 250
10. Find ages where more than 2 students are present

Use aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING where required.
