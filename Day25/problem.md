## Day 25 – FULL JOIN (Complete Join)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**students**
- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- city (VARCHAR)

**enrollments**
- enrollment_id (INT)
- student_id (INT)
- course (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Retrieve all students and all enrollments
2. Display records where students or enrollments do not have a match
3. Identify students without enrollments and enrollments without students
4. Understand how FULL JOIN combines LEFT and RIGHT JOIN
5. Analyze complete data coverage using FULL JOIN

Focus on combining all rows from both tables.
