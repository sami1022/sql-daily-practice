## Day 19 – Composite Keys (Multi-column PRIMARY KEY)

### Problem Statement

You are designing a database table where a single column
is not sufficient to uniquely identify each record.

The table must ensure:
- Uniqueness using a combination of columns
- No duplicate combinations are allowed
- Data integrity is maintained

Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a table with a composite PRIMARY KEY
2. Insert valid records into the table
3. Attempt to insert duplicate composite key values
4. Understand how composite keys ensure uniqueness
5. Identify scenarios where composite keys are required

Focus on multi-column PRIMARY KEY usage.
