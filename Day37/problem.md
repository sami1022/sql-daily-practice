### Problem Statement

You are given a table `employees` with the following columns:

- employee_id (INT)
- first_name (VARCHAR)
- last_name (VARCHAR)
- email (VARCHAR)
- department (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Combine first name and last name into a full name
2. Display employee full name with department
3. Calculate the length of employee names
4. Find employees whose name length exceeds a given value
5. Understand how CONCAT and LENGTH functions work

Focus on **string combination and length calculation**.
