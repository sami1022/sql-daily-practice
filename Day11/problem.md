## Day 11 – HAVING (Filter Groups)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find cities where the average marks are greater than 70  
2. Find cities having more than 5 students  
3. Find ages where the average marks are less than 60  
4. Find cities where the maximum marks are greater than 90  
5. Find cities where the total marks scored exceed 500  
6. Find cities where the minimum marks are less than 40  

Focus on filtering grouped data using the HAVING clause.
