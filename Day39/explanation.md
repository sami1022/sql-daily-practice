## Day 39 – Numeric Functions (Conceptual Explanation)

Numeric functions are used to manipulate
and format numerical data in SQL.

They are widely used in financial calculations,
analytics, and reporting.

---

### ROUND Function
ROUND is used to round a number
to a specified number of decimal places.

Key points:
- Can round up or down
- Accepts optional precision
- Common in financial data

---

### CEIL (Ceiling) Function
CEIL rounds a number
up to the nearest integer.

Key points:
- Always rounds upward
- Useful in pricing rules
- Often used in billing systems

---

### FLOOR Function
FLOOR rounds a number
down to the nearest integer.

Key points:
- Always rounds downward
- Useful for thresholds
- Helps enforce minimum limits

---

### Why Numeric Rounding is Important
- Financial accuracy
- Consistent reporting
- Avoiding floating-point issues
- Business rule compliance

---

### Using Numeric Functions in Calculations
- Can be combined with arithmetic
- Used before displaying results
- Helps standardize output

---

### Performance Considerations
- Numeric functions are lightweight
- Safe for most datasets
- Avoid excessive recalculations

---

### Common Mistakes
- Rounding too early in calculations
- Ignoring decimal precision
- Confusing CEIL and FLOOR
- Assuming ROUND always rounds up

---

### Real-World Applications
- Pricing and discounts
- Financial dashboards
- Ratings and scores
- Sales analytics

---

### Summary
- ROUND controls decimal precision
- CEIL always rounds up
- FLOOR always rounds down
- Essential for numeric data handling
- Important SQL interview topic
