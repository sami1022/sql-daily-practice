## Day 10 – GROUP BY (Grouped Aggregation)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Count the number of students in each city  
2. Find the average marks for each city  
3. Find the maximum marks in each city  
4. Find the minimum age in each city  
5. Count the number of students for each age  
6. Find total marks scored by students from each city  

Focus on understanding grouped aggregation using the GROUP BY clause.
