## Day 40 – Date Functions (DATE, EXTRACT)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `orders` with the following columns:

- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- order_date (TIMESTAMP)
- delivery_date (DATE)
- amount (DECIMAL)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Extract only the date from a timestamp
2. Extract year, month, and day from a date
3. Find orders placed in a specific year
4. Find orders placed in a specific month
5. Understand how DATE and EXTRACT functions work

Focus on **working with dates and date parts**.
