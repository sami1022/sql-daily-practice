## Day 51 – Indexes (CREATE INDEX)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `orders` with the following columns:

- order_id (INT)
- customer_id (INT)
- order_date (DATE)
- amount (DECIMAL)
- status (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Create an index on customer_id
2. Create a composite index on customer_id and order_date
3. Create a unique index
4. Drop an index
5. Understand how indexing improves performance

Focus on CREATE INDEX and performance concepts.
