## Day 32 – Correlated Subquery (Advanced)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find students who scored above the average marks of their city
2. Find students who have the highest marks in their city
3. Retrieve students whose marks are greater than at least one student in the same city
4. Find students whose marks are equal to the maximum marks in their city
5. Understand how correlated subqueries work row by row

Focus on **correlated subqueries** and their execution logic.
