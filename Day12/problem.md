## Day 12 – GROUP BY + HAVING (Combined Queries)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find cities where the average marks are greater than 75  
2. Find cities having more than 3 students and average marks above 60  
3. Find ages where more than 2 students are present  
4. Find cities where total marks scored are greater than 300  
5. Find cities where the maximum marks are greater than 90  
6. Find cities where the minimum marks are less than 40  

Focus on combining GROUP BY with HAVING for grouped filtering.
