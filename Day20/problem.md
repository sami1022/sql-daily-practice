## Day 20 – Practice (Constraints)

### Practice Set

You are designing tables for a small academic system.
Apply different SQL constraints to ensure data integrity.

Use the following constraints where appropriate:
- PRIMARY KEY
- FOREIGN KEY
- UNIQUE
- NOT NULL
- CHECK
- DEFAULT
- Composite PRIMARY KEY

Tasks:

1. Create a students table with appropriate constraints
2. Create a courses table with UNIQUE course codes
3. Create an enrollments table using a composite PRIMARY KEY
4. Enforce referential integrity using FOREIGN KEY
5. Apply CHECK constraints for valid data ranges
6. Use DEFAULT values where applicable

The goal is to practice combining multiple constraints
in real-world table designs.
