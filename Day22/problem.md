## Day 22 – INNER JOIN (Matching Rows)

### Problem Statement

You are given two tables:

**students**
- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- city (VARCHAR)

**enrollments**
- enrollment_id (INT)
- student_id (INT)
- course (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Retrieve students along with their enrolled courses  
2. Display student names and courses only where a valid match exists  
3. Find students who are enrolled in at least one course  
4. Retrieve city-wise enrolled students  
5. Understand how INNER JOIN works with matching rows  

Focus on using INNER JOIN correctly.
