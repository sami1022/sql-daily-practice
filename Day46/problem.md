## Day 46 – IS NULL (NULL Checks & Filtering)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `employees` with the following columns:

- employee_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- email (VARCHAR)
- bonus (DECIMAL)
- department (VARCHAR)

Some fields may contain NULL values.

Write SQL queries to:

1. Find employees with NULL bonus
2. Find employees without an email address
3. Find employees who have a department assigned
4. Replace NULL filtering with proper NULL checks
5. Understand how IS NULL and IS NOT NULL work

Focus on correct NULL comparison in SQL.
