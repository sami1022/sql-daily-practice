## Day 06 – LIMIT & OFFSET (Pagination)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)
- age (INT)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Retrieve the top 5 students based on marks  
2. Retrieve the bottom 5 students based on marks  
3. Retrieve the top 3 students from Pune based on marks  
4. Retrieve students ranked from 6 to 10 based on marks  
5. Retrieve the first 10 students sorted by age  
6. Retrieve the next 5 students after skipping the first 10  

Focus on using LIMIT and OFFSET correctly with ORDER BY.
