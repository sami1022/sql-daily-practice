### Problem Statement

You are given a table `employees` with the following columns:

- employee_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- email (VARCHAR)
- city (VARCHAR)
- department (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Convert employee names to uppercase
2. Convert employee cities to lowercase
3. Display names in uppercase and cities in lowercase together
4. Standardize department names using string functions
5. Understand how UPPER and LOWER functions are used in SQL

Focus on **string manipulation using UPPER and LOWER**.
