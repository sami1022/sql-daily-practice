## Day 31 – Subquery in SELECT (Scalar Queries)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Display each student along with the overall average marks
2. Display each student along with the maximum marks scored
3. Show students and the difference between their marks and average marks
4. Display students along with minimum marks in the table
5. Understand how scalar subqueries work in the SELECT clause

Focus on using **scalar subqueries inside SELECT**.
