## Day 43 – CASE WHEN (Conditional Logic)

### Problem Statement

You are given a table `students` with the following columns:

- student_id (INT)
- name (VARCHAR)
- marks (INT)
- city (VARCHAR)

Write SQL queries to:

1. Categorize students based on marks (Pass/Fail)
2. Assign grades (A, B, C, D) using CASE
3. Create performance labels (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor)
4. Use CASE inside ORDER BY
5. Understand how CASE WHEN works in SQL

Focus on **conditional logic using CASE WHEN**.
